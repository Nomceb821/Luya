                <h2>Project Title: Visualization of Socio-Economic</h2>
                <p><b>Objective:</b> Visualizing the unemployment rate trends
                    in African Countries from the year 2021.
                </p>
                <p><b>Technologies:</b> R </p>
                <p><b>Result Summary:</b> Southern African countries have high to moderate
                   unemployment rate compared to Northen and Central African countries.The unemployment rate across Africa is visually clear, indicating a 
                   pattern where unemployment is more concentrated in specific regions, 
                   particularly in the Southern part of the continent. This geographic distribution could be linked to 
                   various factors such as economic policies, levels of industrialization, and access to resources, 
                   which tend to vary significantly across African countries.

                <h2>Project Title: Finding the Number of Clusters</h2>
                <p><b>Objective:</b> To uncover distinct air quality profiles based on key pollutants, including Sulfur Dioxide (SO₂), Nitrogen Dioxide (NO₂), Ozone (O₃), PM2.5, and PM10.
                </p>
                <p><b>Technologies:</b> Python, pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn. </p>
                <p><b>Model Used:</b> KMeans</p>
                <p><b>Result Summary:</b> The PCA revealed clear separations between the three clusters, 
                    with minimal overlaps, suggesting distinct regional air quality profiles.
                    Cluster 3 points were concentrated at higher PCA values, correlating with areas of higher pollution levels.

                <h2>Project Title: Identifying Diabetes Risk Factors with Decision Tree Classification for Early Intervention. </h2>
                <p><b>Objective:</b> To develop a Decision Tree Classifier model that accurately predicts diabetes based on selected patient features.
                </p>
                <p><b>Technologies:</b> Python, pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn. </p>
                <p><b>Model Used:</b> Decision Tree Classifier</p>
                <p><b>Result Summary:</b> Decision Tree Classifier model, achieved an accuracy score of 0.77, indicating that it correctly 
                    classified 77% of cases in the dataset. The model's precision score was 0.76 suggesting that among all instances predicted as diabetes,
                    76% were accurate, reflecting the model's ability to minimize false positives and reduce unnecessary concerns in a medical context.
